Wow, just out of Nonnas and my brain’s like, spaghetti. First off, oh my god, the seats—who decided on those medieval torture devices? Is my back even supposed to curve like that? Like a shrimp? Whatever. Anyway, the  . Did the pizza oven scene make sense? Or was it just me? They’re in the kitchen, and everything’s on fire but somehow, it felt warm…I don't know like my grandma’s hugs when she catches you sneaking a cookie, you know?

Was it Nonnas or some fever dream involving singing lasagnas? The colors were almost edible, seriously, who knew you could taste a  ? All that neon reminded me of, I don't know, candied oranges or something. The popcorn was stale but my mouth didn't notice cause my brain was busy trying to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   straight into thoughts. Oh wow, someone just left their dog barking in here? No, wait, that's in my head. Really noisy theater or I'm losing it, maybe both.

> The scene with the roller-skating pigeons was straight outta some parallel universe where birds understand disco, totally captivating and also kinda silly. Did they even explain that? I think I missed it. It was a fever dream and also someone's art school dissertation, maybe.

There was a moment—did she really use basil like that? Like, I wanted to reach into the screen and high-five her, or maybe ask for a recipe. I mean, who does that? But somehow it was perfect. Oh and someone remind me to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, Naomi mentioned something about hidden messages in the bread dough? Can't miss that. Oh wait, I forgot to reply to her text. Where’s my phone.

The pigs in the scene? Metaphorical pigs or just actual pigs being fabulous? It feels like trying to explain a dream you had when you were twelve and had too much soda before bed.
